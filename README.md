# DHBW_Scrape
The purpose of this script is to get all relevant information about the DHBW Company's into Excel and onto Google Maps asell. For this I'm using [dryscrape](https://github.com/niklasb/dryscrape), [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and [Xlsx Writer](http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/).
