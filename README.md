# DHBW_Scrape
The purpose of this script is to get all relevant information about the DHBW Company's into Excel and onto Google Maps aswell. For this I'm using [dryscrape](https://github.com/niklasb/dryscrape), [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), [Xlsx Writer](http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/) and [Google Fusion Tables](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232)

### Maps

The maps are currently hosted at https://thaiminater.github.io/DHBW_Scrape/
